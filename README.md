# DataStructures-Spring2016
This repository contains my work for the class of Data Structures taken at The University of Oklahoma during the Spring 2016.
Each folder contains a different project.
All projects were written in Visual Studio using Windows. Input files were added in the debbuging mode of visual studio.
As a requirement of the TA, I started to write all projects in single cpp files.
